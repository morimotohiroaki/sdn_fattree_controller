this is creating virtual research environment for SDN MPI
all os is minimal centos 6.5
1. install host os
 a. install from net install
   ethernet : em1     # could be change in start.sh
   ip : 133.1.134.53  # 
   hostname : pluto   # could be change in hostname.sh

 b. set up nopassword to sudoer
   # visudo
   add line
     huchka ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

 c. copy all host folder to pluto
   ssh pluto yum install openssh-clients -y
   scp -r Host pluto:~/

 d. execute shell
   ssh pluto
   ./start.sh  # this will install required packages and construct network (with 3 switches) 

 e. install master
   ./master.sh sdn-bridge local-bridge outside-bridge # those bridges are setted in start.sh
     ex. ./master.sh br1 brlocal brout
   eth0 : to sdn network (sdn-bridge) 00:00:00:00:00:01
   eth1 : to cluster general network (local-bridge) aa:00:00:00:00:01
   eth2 : to internet (outside-bridge)  aa:aa:00:00:00:01 133.1.134.54
   hostname : venus

 d. install slave
   ./slave.sh vm-number(single digit) sdn-bridge local-bridge outside-bridge
   ex. ./slave.sh 3 br2 brlocal



2. setting on master
  ssh slave yum install openssh-clients -y
  copy cluster folder to master
  scp -r Cluster master:~/
  ./master.sh
  need to write 0 to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf ip4_forwarding = 0



3. setting on slave
  ssh slave yum install openssh-clients -y
  scp slave.sh slave:~/
  ssh slave
  ./slave.sh vm-number
